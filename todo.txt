(1)Data Augmentation (hflip,vflip,brighth,zoom,shift)

(2)implement train on crop and valid on full
	(2.1)epoch with different crop size
	2.2)epoch with different batch size -> to increment training speed
	2.3)batch with balanced class

(3)Use lr scheduler

4)Different loss (dice+bce -> lovasz)


When reached a decent level of segmentation-dice (0.7)


5)Pre classification stage to remove false positive (defect vs non-defect imgs)
	5)implement data gnerator as segmentation

6)New Models (EfficientNet/FPN)
7)Multi models ensamble
