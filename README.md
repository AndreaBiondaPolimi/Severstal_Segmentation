# Severstal_Segmentation

1. Test results with efficientnet preprocessing (viewing part of test)
2. Test with 2 preprocessing functions (use efficientnet also for classification)
3. Test classification network results
4. Prepare presentation with open questions
	1. Train on crop, infer on complete
	2. Sigmoid vs Softmax
	3. Classification (full) + Segmentation (crop) in cascade
	4. Too small batch size
